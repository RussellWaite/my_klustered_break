# My Klustered Break

My very own Klustered break - yey

I jumped at the chance of submitting my very own broken cluster for a special episode of Klustered, where David himself will tackling the diagnosis. Despite not being anywhere near the level of engineer Rawkode's usual guests are (which will probably be quite visible when the cluster is fixed in 60 seconds), you've just got to take opportunities when they come your way. I made sure I wasn't depriving anyone else, and once that was confirmed, I said I was in and started thinking of "my break".

I've watched quite a few of the episodes (not all as I only discovered the channel on the last day of KubeCon EU 2021), so I have an idea of what has been done before in recent weeks, and have watched how Rawkode helps the guests when they are unsure, "just delete it".

I ruled out a few ideas that I would love to detail here but instead am going to try to make a reality on my kind cluster just in case David ever does another community episode again and has a spare cluster for my crumby ideas.

With that in mind, I lowered my sights a little ad decided a few simpler breaks that compliment one another might be a good idea and then I had a silly idea to theme this on an old TV show I remember...

## The Crystal M̵a̵z̵e̵ Cluster

From what I remember of the TV show, there were 4 zones you had to go through to get time in the 5th zone which was a big crystal ball with gold and silver tickets. That last part is irrelevant to this break as all I did were 4 complimentary breaks of the cluster (which if anyone is interested was 1.22.0). 

I'll just remind you "there are 2 difficult things in software, naming things, cache invalidation and out by one errors". My Crystal Cluster idea doesn't use cache... 

Was it a good enough break? I think this means yes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BFbrrXKMOM&t=2210s

See [install guide](./install.md) if you want to put this onto your own throwaway cluster (I developed this break against a kind cluster so if you can get one up and running and put Rawkode's app on it, you can have a go yourself if you've not already watched how to solve it)

Alternatively, if you want to hear a bit more on how I came up with the breaks, this page details it (and explains the zone names, well as best as they can be explained) [deeper ramblings on the break](./break-backstory.md)

Overall it was great fun and I'd recommend anyone who gets the chance to submit a break if David ever opens this up to the community again, go for it. Now if only I could somehow download the other breaks on the show and try to fix them myself...
