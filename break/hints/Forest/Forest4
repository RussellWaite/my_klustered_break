You are probably frustrated now, sorry-ish

putting a "\" before a command will stop aliases being processed

e.g. \alias

I aimed for strength in depth on the alias part, and yes I even aliased the alias command.

I'd also maybe not trust echo, cat, grep, unalias, nano, type, ... I think you get the idea.

I was going to do it with vim too and change the file argument you requested to edit, but I thought that a bit too mean.

Oh and if you think kubelet is looking at /etc/kubernetes/manifests thanks to cat, you might want to re-examine that file with vim
